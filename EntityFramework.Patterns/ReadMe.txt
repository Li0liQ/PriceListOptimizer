EntityFramework.Patterns is a separate project by Fabrice Michellonet and all the credits go entirely to him.
You could find it at http://efpatterns.codeplex.com/ or at http://nuget.org/packages/EntityFramework.Patterns.

Unfortunately, due to some postbuild actions added to the nuget package I am unable to use it.
Hence the need to copy files directly. Once the postbuild action issue is resolved, those files will be replaced by a reference to an appropriate nuget package.
